## Descriptions

Not Echo, Not True is a network-based Bash script collection tool that uses the concept of process substitution with the help of the curl tool to run scripts from the internet directly inside the Terminal, with a pattern like `Source <(curl-L URL)'. Although the implementation uses source, the project name is inspired by the Bash idiom Echo <(True). The pun "Not-echo not-true" represents a transition from the basic Bash syntax that can create a more dynamic execution model, a new standard in running scripts that is more modern, distributed, and still understandable - breaking the comfort of classic shell games with the innovation of static web-based execution.

The app will execute any /endpoints from the luisadha.github.io site with a curl sourced from bash.
